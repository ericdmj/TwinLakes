### Description:

A full-stack app based on ArcGIS Online for navigating Twin Lakes State Park in Prince Edward County, Virginia.

I wanted to keep the map as clean as possible, so I decided to make virtually all the widgets expandable and put them in their collapsed state except for the Editor, since the main interactivity in this project is for people to be able to add (and edit) bird sightings and issues they see in the park.  There's also a lot of other data! Lodgings, amenities, trail information, details on bird sightings.

Hope you enjoy!
